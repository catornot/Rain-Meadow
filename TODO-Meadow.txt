handholding
	would be so nice to grab cicada be carried by liz etc etc
	"it's of uttermost importance to me that one cannot troll others with this"
	either:
		- invite and accept-to-be-held; or
		- be grabbed by, with no consequences
			you are not heavier nor locked out of anything, no downsides
			Sky has both, with the invite system, but also the "follow"->"hold hand"

creature todo
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
		eventually :tm:
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight (very low prio)
- creatures not cleared on enter creature pipe
	game clears enteringshortcut so they "abort entering" most of the time?
	could also be that npcdestination is null so they just bounce?
- eggbug and lanternmouse are way too fast in zerog


lizard todo
	blues have trouble sticking to the ceiling
	blues have trouble climbing/pathing ledges
	lizard wallclimb is slow, slows you down a lot in zerog movement
	red and some more lizs are having trouble climbing


scav todo
	scav climbpos doesn't sync
	pointing doesn't let go once let go?
	scav latching to pole with lots of momentum lets go? shelter room to drainage spot
	scav has trouble walljumping, doesn't count as walljumpable sometimes, hic02 lower spot (check?)


noot todo
	noot gets stuck on water surface, seems to always go left?


following others around is hard
	need map implemented
	could use pipes flashing colors if room inhabited
	player list on passage screen


echo
	echo sky animation is too slow needs to converge
	echo reward anim is bad, fade to white is bad, no confetti??
	echo tentacle bounces bet screens in long rooms
	squid had trouble in dsb06 underwater poles?


accessibility
	ds a09, the crawlspace on left, creatures don't snap to crawling in it
	ds c03 exist is at water height wont path
	dsa13 corner up lizard stuck


emotes
	wish there was a symbol for outskirts
	emotes go off-screen too often, need to show them in-screen near the creature when possible
	emotes sometimes don't stop fading when new emotes are added
	rotating arrow symbol resets to up on remote when client lets go
	emote bg tint too strong, same for text

customization
	tints could blend in HSL, currently blends towards desat always because of the nature of the maths


input
	throw is for switching pages on hotwheel, but also call, specially on controller
	rebindable keybinds for everything meadow
		- controller emote input
		- tab
	- people don't like locking in place while pointing
		// could combine with "look", after all just looking is kind of meh
	- scav and scug don't stop pointing even when you let go of call


gameplay
	toggle collision as a setting
	world state of onlineplayer is a lot of rot etc because no filters apply

	music plays maybe too often
		rethink triggers
		maybe options


menus
	redo scavenger selectscreen
	on meadow-menu or lobby menu, esc doesn't go back
	backing out of passage screen sends you to main menu? unconfirmed but plausible
