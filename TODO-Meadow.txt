handholding
	would be so nice to grab cicada be carried by liz etc etc
	"it's of uttermost importance to me that one cannot troll others with this"
	either:
		- invite and accept-to-be-held; or
		- be grabbed by, with no consequences
			you are not heavier nor locked out of anything, no downsides
			Sky has both, with the invite system, but also the "follow"->"hold hand"

creature todo
- can get stuck
	some rooms will get fixed
		eventually :tm:

- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight (very low prio)

lizard todo
	blues have trouble sticking to the ceiling
	blues have trouble climbing/pathing ledges

"creature emotions" need addressing
lizards shouldn't open mouth to bite -> can't reproduce
rats shouldn't panic
slugcat arm reaches to threat

following others around is hard
	need map implemented
	could use pipes flashing colors if room inhabited
	player list on passage screen

wormgrass can still eat you (big patches in FA)
prevents pathing still

echo sky animation is too slow needs to converge

echo reward anim is bad, fade to white is bad, no confetti??

wish there was a symbol for outskirts

double jumps out of the water, way too much speed

ds a09, the crawlspace on left, creatures don't snap to crawling in it

ds c03 exist is at water height wont path

creatures not cleared on enter creature pipe
	game clears enteringshortcut so they "abort entering" most of the time?
	could also be that npcdestination is null so they just bounce?

echo tentacle bounces bet screens in long rooms

scav climbpos doesn't sync

emotes go off-screen too often, need to show them in-screen near the creature when possible

toggle collision as a setting

noot gets stuck on water surface, seems to always go left?

redo scavenger selectscreen

emotes sometimes don't stop fading when new emotes are added

on meadow-menu or lobby menu, esc doesn't go back

scav latching to pole with lots of momentum lets go? shelter room to drainage spot

dsa13 corner up lizard stuck

squid had trouble in dsb06 underwater poles?

scav has trouble walljumping, doesn't count as walljumpable sometimes, hic02 lower spot

backing out of passage screen sends you to main menu? unconfirmed

eggbug and lanternmouse are way too fast in zerog

lizard wallclimb is slow, slows you down a lot in zerog movement

rebindable keybinds for everything meadow
- controller emote input
- tab

world state of onlineplayer is a lot of rot etc because no filters apply

rotating arrow symbol resets to up on remote when client lets go

throw is for switching pages on hotwheel, but also call, specially on controller

red and some more lizs are having trouble climbing

scav and scug don't stop pointing even when you let go of call

emote bg tint too strong
